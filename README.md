- 👋 Hi, I’m @sq-modelling
- 👀 I’m interested in developing non-singular boundary element methods for science and engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fast direct solvers for boundary element methods.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fast methods, such as fast multipole method, to improve the efficiency of the non-singular boundary element method.
